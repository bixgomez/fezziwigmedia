# INSTRUCTIONS.md

## Overview
- This is a WordPress site.
- Local development is done using DDEV.

## Workflow

- Always start a session by addressing me in a friendly way. My name is Richard!
- Never use emojis in code, READMEs, or any files that will be committed, pushed, and deployed
  - Emojis are OK in branch notes (dev_assets/) for internal documentation
- Do not issue any git, composer, or npm commands without asking me first.
- All dev notes files reside in ./dev_assets/

## Branch-based development

- At the start of each session, after our greeting, please ask me which branch
  we will be working on. When I inform you, please look in dev_assets for an md
  file whose name matches the branch name. 
- If you don't find the md file in the root of dev_assets, look for a directory
  by that name. If that exists, please look in there for the md file. Also
  review any other files that are in that directory.
- If a directory does not exist whose name matches the branch name, please 
  create it and move the file into it if it exists.
- If the file doesn't exist, please create it inside the directory of the same name. 
- If the file does exist, please read it thoroughly and understand it completely.
- Append dated entries at the end of the md file in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format
  Precede each heading with a blank line.
- **IMPORTANT: After each and every exchange with Richard, log what was discussed
  to the branch-specific md file.** This includes:
  - What questions or requests Richard made
  - Any findings, discoveries, or analysis you performed
  - Suggestions or recommendations you provided
  - Code changes made
  - Commands to run
  - Decisions made
  - Any relevant context for future sessions
